# Three.js Icosahedron with GUI

This project is a simple demonstration of using Three.js to create an interactive 3D icosahedron with a graphical user interface (GUI) for adjusting various parameters. It is part of my learning journey with Three.js.

## Features

- Displays a 3D icosahedron with a wireframe overlay
- Allows real-time adjustment of the icosahedron's geometry (radius and level of detail)
- Provides options to change the material color and shading of the icosahedron
- Enables control over the wireframe color and visibility
- Offers a hemisphere light with adjustable colors for the sky and ground
- Includes orbit controls for interactive camera movement

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Somu-ed/threejs-icosahedron-gui.git`

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

- Use the GUI controls to adjust the icosahedron's geometry, material, wireframe, and lighting.
- Click and drag the mouse to rotate the camera around the icosahedron.
- Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

## Dependencies

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in a web browser.
- [lil-gui](https://lil-gui.georgealways.com/) - A lightweight graphical user interface for changing variables in JavaScript.

## File Structure
